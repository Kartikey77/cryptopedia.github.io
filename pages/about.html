        <h1>What Is CryptoCurrency</h1>
        <p><span> cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of
                exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government
                or bank, to uphold or maintain it. It is a decentralized system for verifying that the parties to a
                transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such
                as banks, when funds are being transferred between two entities.Individual coin ownership records are
                stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure
                transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin
                ownership. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional
                sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities,
                securities, as well as</span>currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class
            in practice. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model,
            owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the
            amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via
            network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical
            form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use
            decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).When a cryptocurrency is minted
            or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When
            implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology,
            typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. Traditional asset classes
            like currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as macroeconomic factors, have modest exposures to
            cryptocurrency returns.The first decentralized cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which first released as
            open-source software in 2009. As of March 2022 there were more than 9,000 other cryptocurrencies in the
            marketplace, of which more than 70 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.</p>
